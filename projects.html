                <h2>Looking Up</h2>
                <p>Looking up is a 3D Adventure game created as part of a client project for UConn Wellness and Prevention. It is a game that 
                    tracks health, social, food, and sleep bars in order to teach kids (without lecturing) the importances of their health. It is also
                    a game that includes an ambient music track, and light colors to promote relaxation while playing. For this project, I did concept art, 
                    main menu animations, and wrote the code for the inventory and dialog system. A downloadable version of the game can be found <a href="lookingup.zip">here.</a>

          <h2>Courtroom 600</h2>
          <p>Courtroom 600 is a Virtual Reality game that I have been working on with a group since September 2018.
            This project is based off of the Nuremberg trials that were held in 1945-1946. The experience puts the user
            inside the courtroom where they will be tasked to go through a series of courtroom activies, including pre-trial and the trial.
            The game is in early stages, so I have been researching about the Trials. In the future, I will be helping with the work in Unity
            to create the game.

            <h2>By Candlelight</h2>
          </a>
          <p>By Candlelight is a 2D Puzzle Platformer created with Construct 3. I worked on this project as part of a group for Introduction to Digital Game Design
            in Spring of 2018. For this game, I was responsible for adding the art assests to the project and using the Construct built-in scripts to create
            functioning game mechanics. These mechanics included all of the lighting effects that take place (i.e. flickering light in intro, the candle on/off to control
            what access to the map the player had). I also was in charge of the level design for the game.

            <h2>Pit Of Doom</h2>
          </a>
          <p>Pit of Doom is a 2D virtual game that I worked on in the Fall of 2017 for an Intro to Scripting Final Project. It drew inspiration from a Tetris board,
            with a survive as long as you can twist. For this project, I used C# in Unity2D to write scripts for player score, player health, block health,
            as well as a secondary camera in order for the player to see an overview of the game board and where the blocks may be coming from next.

            <h2>Zzzombies</h2>
          </a>
          <p>Zzzombies was a short film project about the importance of getting enough sleep. In this project, I used Adobe Premiere to piece together scenes in the movie.
            This includes smooth transitioning between scenes, and adding extra sound and video effects. I also used Adobe Photoshop to edit some of the movie's title poster. 
            My role in the film's production was not all on the computer side, as I also filmed and acted in portions of the movie.

            <h2>Chicago Hitman</h2>
          </a>
          <p>Chicago Hitman is a turn-based board game. The architects are trying to complete all the buildings for the 1983 Chicago Fair on time, 
            but the killer is trying to do everything he can to stop them. For this project, I helped create game mechanics and develop the turn phases.
            I also helped create some of the cards used in the game. This was the first physical game I have that made that was strictly game design and no programming.
